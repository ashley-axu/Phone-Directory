# Phone Directory
- Develop a Java program that maintains a list of names and phone numbers, or a phone directory of your friends.

- In addition, it also provides a user-friendly and menu-driven program to allow the user to select and execute the following operations/services:
        # 1. Load a previously saved phone directory from file
        # 2. Add or change an entry
        # 3. Remove an entry
        # 4. Search for an entry
        # 5. Display all entries
        # 6. Save the current phone directory to a file
        # 7. Quit the program
